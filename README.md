📚 What You'll Learn
Core JavaScript Concepts
Variables - Store and manage data
javascript
   let playerName = "Alex";
   let score = 0;
Functions - Create reusable code blocks
javascript
   function sayHello(name) {
       return "Hello, " + name + "! 👋";
   }
Conditionals - Make decisions in code
javascript
   if (score > 10) {
       console.log("You're doing great!");
   }
Loops - Repeat actions efficiently
javascript
   for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
       console.log("Jump number " + i);
   }
